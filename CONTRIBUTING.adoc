Contributing to git-fortune
===========================

First off, thank you so much for taking the time to contribute! :+1:

Guidelines:

  - All code is autoformatted with https://github.com/ambv/black[black] and
     https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort[isort]. You may run
      `make autoformat` to do this or configure these tools for use in your
      editor.
  - All code must pass `make test`, which runs linting and tests.
  - Use no dependencies -- git-fortune should be written in pure stdlib python
  - Yes, keep the code python2 compatible, even though python2 will soon be EOL

NOTE: `black` requires python3.6+, but the code does not
